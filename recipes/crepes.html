    <h3>Holy Crepe!</h3>

         <p>Crepes are a delightfully thin and delicate French pancake that can be enjoyed any time of day. They're not only delicious, but also incredibly versatile and easy to make! With just a few simple ingredients and a bit of practice, you can whip up a batch of these scrumptious treats in no time. Whether you prefer your crepes sweet or savory, the possibilities are endless. So, roll up your sleeves, grab a spatula, and let's get cooking!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>    
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crepe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
